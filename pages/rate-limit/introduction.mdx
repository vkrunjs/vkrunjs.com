description: "Learn how to implement and configure the Rate Limit middleware in Vkrun to manage client request rates effectively and secure your API against overuse."

## Introduction

The Rate Limit middleware is designed to control the request rate from clients by limiting the number of requests that can be made within a specified time window. It is useful for protecting APIs against overuse or abuse by rate-limiting requests based on configurable parameters such as time window and request limit.

### Quick Start

```ts
import v from "vkrun"

const app = v.App()
app.rateLimit({ windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, limit: 100 }) // 100 requests per 15 minutes

app.get("/rate-limit", (request: v.Request, response: v.Response) => {
  response.status(200).send("Rate limit applied!")
})

app.server().listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server started on port 3000 with Rate Limit enabled")
})
```
