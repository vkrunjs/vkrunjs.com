## Introduction

The Mime provides a simple way to resolve the correct MIME type based on a file extension. This utility is essential when handling file uploads or downloads in web applications, ensuring the correct Content-Type headers are set.

### Quick Start

```ts
import v from "vkrun"

const mimeType = v.mime.type("pdf")

console.log(mimeType) // "application/pdf"
```
