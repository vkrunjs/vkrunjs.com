It details both passed and failed validations, enabling precise debugging and understanding of validation outcomes. This method is ideal for scenarios where immediate feedback on the validation process is required."

## Schema - Test

The `.test` method validates a value against a predefined schema and provides detailed test results, including both successful and failed validations. It is especially useful for debugging and understanding why a validation failed.

---

### Syntax

```ts
.test(value: any, valueName: string): Tests
```

- **value**: The value to be validated.
- **valueName**: A string used to reference the value in the validation output.

---

### Example

The following example demonstrates how to use `.test` to validate a number and inspect the results:


```ts
import { schema } from "vkrun"

const schema = schema().number().float()

const testA = schema.test(123.5, "value_name")
const testB = schema.test(123, "value_name")
```

Output testA:

```ts
{
  passedAll: true,
  passed: 3,
  failed: 0,
  totalTests: 3,
  successes: [
    {
      method: "required",
      name: "value_name",
      expect: "value other than undefined",
      received: 123.5
    },
    {
      method: "number",
      name: "value_name",
      expect: "number type",
      received: 123.5
    },
    {
      method: "float",
      name: "value_name",
      expect: "float type",
      received: 123.5
    }
  ],
  errors: [],
  time: "0s 1ms"
}
```

Output testB:

```ts
{
  passedAll: false,
  passed: 2,
  failed: 1,
  totalTests: 3,
  successes: [
    {
      method: "required",
      name: "value_name",
      expect: "value other than undefined",
      received: 123
    },
    {
      method: "number",
      name: "value_name",
      expect: "number type",
      received: 123
    }
  ],
  errors: [
    {
      method: "float",
      type: "invalid value",
      name: "value_name",
      expect: "float type",
      received: 123,
      message: "value_name must be a float!"
    }
  ],
  time: "0s 1ms"
}
```
