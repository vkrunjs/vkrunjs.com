## Schema - Buffer

The `.buffer` method is used to validate whether a given value is of type `Buffer`. It ensures that the input is an instance of the `Buffer` class, which is typically used to handle raw binary data, such as when working with files, streams, or binary communication.

This method is essential for enforcing strict type validation where only `Buffer` values are acceptable, making it useful for scenarios like validating binary data, file uploads, or raw byte streams.

### Example

Below is an example of how to use `.buffer` to validate whether a value is a valid `Buffer`:

```ts
import { schema } from "vkrun"

const schemaValidation = schema().buffer()

const validateA = schemaValidation.validate(Buffer.from("test"))  // Valid Buffer
const validateB = schemaValidation.validate("test")               // Invalid, string is not a Buffer

console.log(validateA) // true
console.log(validateB) // false
```
