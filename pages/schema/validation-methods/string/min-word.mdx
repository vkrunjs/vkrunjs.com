## Schema - MinWord

The `.minWord` method is used to validate whether a given string contains at least a specified number of words. This method ensures that the input meets the minimum word count requirement, making it particularly useful for fields like names, comments, or any input where word count is significant.

### Example

Below is an example of how to use `.minWord` to validate whether a string contains the required number of words:

```ts
import { schema } from "vkrun"

const schema = schema().string().minWord(2)

const validateA = schema.validate("one two")
const validateB = schema.validate("one")

console.log(validateA) // true
console.log(validateB) // false
```
