## Schema - MaxLength (String)

The `.maxLength` method is used to validate whether a given string does not exceed a specified maximum length. It ensures that the input string contains no more than the allowed number of characters, providing a way to enforce upper length constraints on user input or other string-based data.

This method is particularly useful in scenarios where overly long strings might cause issues, such as database storage, user interface limitations, or specific data validation rules.

### Example

Below is an example of how to use `.maxLength` to validate whether a string respects the maximum length:

```ts
import { schema } from "vkrun"

const schema = schema().string().maxLength(5)

const validateA = schema.validate("12345")
const validateB = schema.validate("123456")

console.log(validateA) // true
console.log(validateB) // false
```
