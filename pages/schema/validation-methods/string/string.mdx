## Schema - String

The `.string` method is used to validate whether a given value is of type `string`. It ensures that the input meets the expected data type criteria and can be further combined with additional validation methods to define specific rules for string inputs, such as length restrictions, patterns, or formats.

This method is the foundation for validating textual data in your application, providing flexibility to handle diverse use cases like validating names, emails, or any string-based input.

### Example

Below is an example of how to use `.string` to validate whether a value is a valid string:

```ts
import { schema } from "vkrun"

const exampleSchema = schema().string()

const validateA = exampleSchema.validate("any text")
const validateB = exampleSchema.validate(false)

console.log(validateA) // true
console.log(validateB) // false
```
