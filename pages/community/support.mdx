### Support

VkrunJS is an open-source project licensed under the MIT License, with its ongoing development powered by community support. This framework is the result of countless hours of dedication, long nights, and working **after hours** on busy weekends.

#### How You Can Help

Unlike other projects backed by large companies, VkrunJS doesn't have a team constantly funding its development. The growth of this framework heavily relies on the **generosity** ❤️ of the community. However, my goal is to continue making this framework even more **powerful**, so I can dedicate all my focus to providing solutions that make coding an enjoyable process. To help support me, I have a few platforms available:

- Make a one-time donation via [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=25N5ECKX3GHWA)
- Become a contributor or learn more by visiting the [Contributing Page](/community/contributing)

If you've fallen in love with VkrunJS or if your business is using it, consider supporting its development. This will help ensure that the project you rely on remains **actively maintained** and improved. Additionally, your support could enable me to create more content for the VkrunJS community, whether it's through educational blog posts or video tutorials.
