### Introduction

The Upload middleware in Vkrun provides a powerful solution for handling file uploads in your application. It supports both disk and memory storage and includes built-in validation for file size, type, and other constraints. This middleware is designed to work seamlessly with the `parseData` middleware for handling `multipart/form-data` requests.

#### Features:
- Supports single and multiple file uploads.
- Disk and memory storage options.
- Customizable file validation for size, extensions, and required fields.
- Custom error handling for upload constraints.

### Quick Start

```ts
import v from "vkrun"

const app = v.App()
app.use(v.parseData())

const upload = v.upload.diskStorage({
  destination: "./uploads",
  filename: (file) => `custom-${file.fieldName}-${Date.now()}.${file.extension}`
}).singleFile({
  fieldName: "file",
  required: { enable: true },
  size: { value: 5000000 }, // 5MB
  extensions: { value: ["png", "jpg"] }
})

app.post("/upload", upload, (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).json({ message: "File uploaded successfully!", file: req.files })
})

app.server().listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server is running on port 3000")
})
```
