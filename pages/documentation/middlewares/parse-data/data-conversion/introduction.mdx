## Introduction to Data Conversion

The Parse Data middleware is designed to automatically parse and convert incoming request data into appropriate JavaScript types. This process ensures consistent and structured data for your application.

Supported data formats include:

- **Query parameters**
- **URL parameters**
- **JSON body**
- **URL-encoded form data**
- **Multipart form data** (including file uploads)

### Security Features

Parse Data also provides built-in protection against SQL injection attacks. By enabling the `escapeSQL` option, the middleware sanitizes user input to prevent malicious queries, adding an additional layer of security to your application.

By automating these processes, Parse Data reduces the need for manual parsing and validation, allowing you to focus on application logic while ensuring data consistency and application security.
