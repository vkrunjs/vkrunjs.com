# Advanced Configurations

## Handling Multiple `.env` Files

You can load multiple `.env` files and merge their values:

```ts
loadEnv({ path: [".env", ".env.local"] });
```

> Variables in `.env.local` **override** those in `.env` if duplicate keys exist.

---

## Configurable Override Behavior

By default, `loadEnv()` overrides existing environment variables in `process.env`. You can disable this behavior:

```ts
loadEnv({ override: false });
```

---

## Variable Interpolation

`.env` file:

```env
BASE_URL="http://example.com"
API_URL="$BASE_URL/api"
```

Usage:

```ts
loadEnv();
console.log(process.env.API_URL); // "http://example.com/api"
```

---

## Debugging Mode

To enable debug logs:

```ts
loadEnv({ debug: true });
```

> Logs all loaded environment variables and warnings.
