## Introduction to Vkrun - JWT

The JWT provides a robust solution for token-based authentication and authorization. It facilitates the encryption and decryption of sensitive data, ensuring secure communication between applications.

By leveraging this module, developers can protect user data and validate requests efficiently, making it ideal for modern web applications and APIs.

### Quick Start

Here's how to get started with JWT encryption and decryption:

```ts
import v from "vkrun"

const vkrun = v.App()

// Encrypting a token
const data = { id: 123, name: "John" }
const config = {
  secretKey: "your-secret-key-SHA256",
  expiresIn: "15m"
}

// Creating token
const token = v.jwt().encrypt(data, config) // hash token

// Decrypting a token
const decryptedData = v.jwt().decrypt(token, config.secretKey)
console.log(decryptedData) // { id: 123, name: "John" }
```
