## Router - Controller

A controller is a callback function that handles the request and generates the response for a specific route. In VkrunJS, a controller is typically used when you have a single function that will handle the request for a particular route.

### Example

In this example, the controller `controller` processes the incoming request and sends a response:

```ts
import v from 'vkrun'

const app = v.App()

// Controller function
const controller = (req: v.Request, res: v.Response) => {
  res.send('Hello from the controller!')
}

// Using the controller in a route
app.get('/example', controller)
```

In the above example:

- The `controller` is executed when a `GET` request is made to `/example`.
- It processes the request and sends the response `Hello from the controller!`.

### Benefits of Using Controllers

- **Separation of Concerns**: Controllers allow you to keep your route definitions clean and concise, separating the logic for handling the request.
- **Reusability**: Controllers can be reused across multiple routes or even applications, making your code modular and easier to maintain.

Controllers typically focus on handling a single request and performing the core logic, like fetching data, processing input, or generating the appropriate response.
