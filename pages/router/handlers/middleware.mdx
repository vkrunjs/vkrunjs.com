## Router - Middleware

**Middleware** are functions that run before the final route controller in the handler chain. They can perform operations like modifying the request/response objects, logging, authentication checks, and more. Middleware functions typically call `next()` to pass control to the next handler.

Middleware provides flexibility and reusability by allowing multiple operations to be performed in sequence. Middleware can be applied either to individual routes or globally to all routes in the application.


### Applying Middleware Globally

To apply middleware globally (to all routes), use `app.use(middleware)`. This ensures that the middleware runs on every incoming request, regardless of the route.

### Example: Global Middleware

In this example, `loggerMiddleware` is applied globally to all routes:

```ts
import v from 'vkrun'

const app = v.App()

const loggerMiddleware = (req: v.Request, res: v.Response, next: v.NextFunction) => {
  console.log(`Request received for ${req.method} ${req.url}`)
  next() // Move to the next handler
}

// Apply middleware globally
app.use(loggerMiddleware)

app.get('/route-a', (req: v.Request, res: v.Response) => {
  res.send('This is Route A')
})

app.get('/route-b', (req: v.Request, res: v.Response) => {
  res.send('This is Route B')
})

app.server().listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Vkrun started on port 3000')
})
```

In this example:

`loggerMiddleware` is applied globally using `app.use()`, which means it will log every request to both `/route-a` and `/route-b`, as well as any other routes added later.

### Applying Middleware to Specific Routes

In addition to global middleware, you can apply middleware to specific routes by passing the middleware function as a parameter in the route definition.

### Example: Single Middleware

This middleware logs a message before the controller handles the request:

```ts
import v from 'vkrun'

const app = v.App()

const loggerMiddleware = (req: v.Request, res: v.Response, next: v.NextFunction) => {
  console.log('Request received')
  next() // Move to the next handler
}

const controller = (req: v.Request, res: v.Response) => {
  res.send('Hello World!')
}

app.get('/hello-world', loggerMiddleware, controller)
```

In this example, when a client sends a GET request to `/hello-world`, the `loggerMiddleware` runs first, logs `'Request received'`, and then passes `control` to the controller, which sends `'Hello World!'` as the response.

### Example: Multiple Middleware Functions

You can have multiple middleware functions chained together:

```ts
import v from 'vkrun'

const app = v.App()

const authMiddleware = (req: v.Request, res: v.Response, next: v.NextFunction) => {
  const isAuthenticated = true // Simulate authentication check
  if (!isAuthenticated) {
    return res.status(401).send('Unauthorized')
  }
  next() // If authenticated, move to the next handler
}

const loggerMiddleware = (req: v.Request, res: v.Response, next: v.NextFunction) => {
  console.log('Request is authorized')
  next()
}

const controller = (req: v.Request, res: v.Response) => {
  res.send('Welcome, authenticated user!')
}

app.get('/secure-route', authMiddleware, loggerMiddleware, controller)
```

In this case, two middleware functions are executed before the final controller:

- `authMiddleware` checks if the user is authenticated. If they are not, it sends a `401` Unauthorized response. Otherwise, it calls `next()` to pass control.
- `loggerMiddleware` logs a message and then passes control to the controller.
- The `controller` sends the final response, `'Welcome, authenticated user!'`.
