description: 'The "Router Request" page explores how VkrunJS leverages Node.js "http.IncomingMessage" to handle HTTP requests. Learn about native properties like "req.method", "req.url", and "req.headers", and how the "parseData" middleware enhances the request object with "req.params", "req.query", and "req.body" for efficient data parsing and handling.'

## Router - Request

VkrunJS utilizes the `http.IncomingMessage` from Node.js' `createServer` to handle requests. The **IncomingMessage** object provides methods and properties to access the data sent by the client in an HTTP request. For more details on the native **IncomingMessage**, refer to the [Node.js IncomingMessage documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#class-httpincomingmessage).

> **Note:** It's important to note that the version of **IncomingMessage** used in VkrunJS depends on the Node.js version installed in your environment. Therefore, there might be slight variations in functionality between different Node.js versions.

### Request Properties

Some examples of native properties provided by `http.IncomingMessage`:

| Property              | Description                                                    |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `req.method`          | The HTTP method used for the request (GET, POST, PUT, etc.).    |
| `req.url`             | The full URL of the request.                                    |
| `req.headers`         | An object containing request headers.                           |

[Node.js IncomingMessage documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#class-httpincomingmessage).

### Example: Basic Request Object

```ts
import v from "vkrun"

const vkrun = v.App()

vkrun.get("/example", (req: v.Request, res: v.Response) => {
  console.log(req.method)  // Outputs: GET
  console.log(req.url)      // Outputs: /example?name=John
  console.log(req.headers)  // Outputs: { host: "localhost:3000", ... }
  res.status(200).end("Request received")
})
```

In addition to the native properties provided by **IncomingMessage**, VkrunJS allows for parsing query strings, URL parameters, and body data through the **parseData** middleware. This middleware adds `req.query`, `req.params`, and `req.body` to the request object.

| Property              | Description                                                    |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `req.params`          | Parameters parsed from the URL (e.g., `/:id` in `/users/:id`).  |
| `req.query`           | An object containing query parameters (e.g., `?name=John`).     |
| `req.body`            | The body data of the request (for POST, PUT and PATCH requests).           |

### Key Points

- The request object in VkrunJS is based on Node.js' `http.IncomingMessage`.
- You can access request data such as URL parameters, query strings, and headers directly when using **parseData**.
- Body data is not parsed automatically; use the **parseData** middleware for handling body content.
