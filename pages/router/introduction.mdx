## Router - Introduction

Router is a VkrunJS module for creating endpoints (URIs) of an application that respond to client requests.

Routes are created using Router methods that correspond to HTTP methods. For example, `router.get()` handles GET requests and `router.post()` handles POST requests. After creating all the routes, it is necessary to inject the Router instance into the `use` method of the VkrunJS app.

Routing methods specify a callback function that is called when the application receives a request to a specified HTTP route and method. The VkrunJS app listens for requests that match the routes and methods, and when there is a match, it calls the specified callback function.

Example:

```ts
import v from 'vkrun'

const vkrun = v.App()
const router = Router()

// When calling the route below it responds with the text hello world
router.get('/', (req: v.Request, res: v.Response) => {
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain')
  res.status(200).end('Hello World!')
})

vkrun.use(router)

vkrun.server().listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('VkrunJS started on port 3000')
})
```

Equivalent:

```ts
import v from 'vkrun'

const vkrun = v.App()

// When calling the route below it responds with the text hello world
vkrun.get('/', (req: v.Request, res: v.Response) => {
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain')
  res.status(200).end('Hello World!')
})

vkrun.server().listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('VkrunJS started on port 3000')
})
```
