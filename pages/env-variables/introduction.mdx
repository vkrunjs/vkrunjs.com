## Introduction to loadEnv

The `loadEnv` utility offers a streamlined approach for managing environment variables in Node.js applications. With support for environment-specific files, schema validation, and advanced options like overriding variables, `loadEnv` ensures your app's configuration is reliable and secure.

## Key Features

- **Automatic Environment Selection**: Automatically loads `.env` files based on the `NODE_ENV` variable (e.g., `.env.test`, `.env.production`).
- **Schema Validation**: Validates environment variables against a schema, ensuring type safety and required fields.
- **Flexible Override Behavior**: Allows control over whether existing environment variables are overridden.
- **Multiple File Support**: Supports loading multiple `.env` files, merging their variables.
- **Automatic Parsing**: Automatically parses JSON-like strings, arrays, booleans, and numbers.
- **Debugging Options**: Enables verbose logging for debugging during development.
- **Comment and Invalid Line Handling**: Gracefully ignores comments and invalid lines in `.env` files.
- **Encoding Customization**: Supports custom file encoding (default is `utf8`).
- **Variable Interpolation**: Expands variables with values from other variables (e.g., `PATH=$HOME/bin`).
- **Backward Compatibility**: Works seamlessly with existing `process.env` variables.
- **Default Fallback**: Falls back to the default `.env` file when `NODE_ENV` is not set or the corresponding file is missing.
- **Non-blocking Errors**: Does not throw errors when `.env` files are missing, unless explicitly instructed.
- **Priority Control**: Gives precedence to `NODE_ENV`-specific files over the default `.env`.

### Quick Start

To begin, create a `.env` file in the root of your project directory:

```bash
API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

Using the `loadEnv`:

```ts
import { loadEnv } from "vkrun"

loadEnv()
console.log(process.env.API_KEY) // "your-api-key"
```

> Note: VkrunJS does not restrict you from using external modules, such as dotenv, if needed.
